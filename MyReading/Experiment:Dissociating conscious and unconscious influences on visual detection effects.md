>Abstract:

>The scope of unconscious processing is highly debated, with recent studies showing that even high-level functions such as perceptual integration and category-based attention occur unconsciously. 
>For example, upright faces that are suppressed from awareness through interocular suppression break into awareness more quickly than inverted faces. 
>Similarly, verbal object cues boost otherwise invisible objects into awareness. 
>Here, we replicate these findings, but find that they reflect a general difference in detectability not specific to interocular suppression. 
>To dissociate conscious and unconscious influences on visual detection effects, we use an additional discrimination task to rule out conscious processes as a cause for these differences. 
>Results from this detection–discrimination dissociation paradigm reveal that, while face orientation is processed unconsciously, category-based attention requires awareness. 
>These findings provide insights into the function of conscious perception and offer an experimental approach for mapping out the scope and limits of unconscious processing.
